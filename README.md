# Haptics-C-Vest
This project (originally proj017) was a haptics feedback vest that a friend and I created back in Jan 2022 for a class.
The project is in C and runs on the STM-32 Nucleo microprocessor, with a custom vest and sensor array.

Credit for certain subroutines and unmodified portions of header files goes to Bernie Roehl.
